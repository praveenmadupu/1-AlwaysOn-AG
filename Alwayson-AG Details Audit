Show Availability groups visible to the Server and Replica information such as Which server is the Primary replica, Sync and Async modes , Readable Secondary and Failover Mode

--Show Availability groups visible to the Server and Replica information such as Which server is the Primary
--Sync and Async modes , Readable Secondary and Failover Mode, these can all be filtered using a Where clause
--if you are running some checks, no Where clause will show you all of the information.
