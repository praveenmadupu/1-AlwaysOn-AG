Applying patches in a SQL Server Always On Availability Group environment requires careful planning to minimize downtime and ensure a smooth update process. 
Here are the general steps to apply a SQL Server patch in an Always On Availability Group environment:

### 1. **Prepare for Maintenance:**

- **Notify Stakeholders:**
  - Inform stakeholders about the planned maintenance window for applying the patch.

- **Backup Databases:**
  - Perform a full backup of all databases in the Availability Group on the primary replica.

- **Monitor Replication:**
  - Ensure that data replication is healthy, and there are no synchronization issues between replicas.

### 2. **Plan for Downtime:**

- **Schedule Maintenance Window:**
  - Choose a suitable maintenance window to minimize the impact on users.

- **Plan for Failover:**
  - Decide whether you will perform a manual failover or allow automatic failover during the patching process.

### 3. **Failover to Secondary Replica:**

- **Manual Failover:**
  - If planned, initiate a manual failover to one of the secondary replicas.
  - Connect applications to the new primary replica.

- **Automatic Failover:**
  - If automatic failover is preferred, ensure that it's configured appropriately.

### 4. **Patch the Secondary Replica:**

- **Install the Patch:**
  - On the secondary replica, apply the SQL Server patch following the vendor's instructions.
  - Ensure the patch version matches the existing primary replica version.

- **Validate Installation:**
  - Verify that the patch installation on the secondary replica was successful.
  - Confirm that databases are accessible and replication is functioning.

### 5. **Failover Back to Original Primary Replica:**

- **Manual Failover:**
  - If a manual failover was initiated, perform a failback to the original primary replica.
  - Reconnect applications to the restored primary replica.

- **Automatic Failover:**
  - If automatic failover is enabled, allow it to occur if necessary.

### 6. **Patch the Original Primary Replica:**

- **Install the Patch:**
  - On the original primary replica (now secondary), apply the SQL Server patch.
  - Follow the same steps as applied to the secondary replica.

- **Validate Installation:**
  - Verify the successful installation of the patch.
  - Confirm that databases are accessible and replication is functioning.

### 7. **Reconfigure Automatic Failover:**

- **Adjust Automatic Failover Settings:**
  - If automatic failover was temporarily disabled, reconfigure it according to your preferences.

### 8. **Post-Patching Validation:**

- **Monitor Replication:**
  - Ensure that data replication is healthy after the patching process.

- **Application Testing:**
  - Test critical applications to ensure they can connect to the primary replica and function as expected.

- **Performance Testing:**
  - Perform performance testing to identify any potential issues introduced by the patch.

### 9. **Communicate Completion:**

- **Notify Stakeholders:**
  - Inform stakeholders that the patching process is complete and confirm the success of the update.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Availability Group Listeners:**
  - If you are using an Availability Group listener, ensure that it's functioning correctly after the patching process.

- **Backup and Restore Certificates (if applicable):**
  - If Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) is in use, ensure that certificates and keys are backed up and restored appropriately.

- **Documentation:**
  - Update documentation to reflect the new patch version and the date of the update.

Always refer to the specific documentation provided by Microsoft and the patch vendor for detailed instructions on applying patches to your SQL Server version. 
Ensure that you thoroughly test the patch in a non-production environment before applying it to your production systems.
